# Running Toggle Functionality - Fixed! 🔧

## Issue Fixed:
The "Include Running" toggle wasn't properly disabling the running button - it just stayed enabled and clickable.

## What Was Wrong:
1. **No Visual Feedback**: The running button looked the same whether enabled or disabled
2. **Still Clickable**: Users could still tap the running button even when disabled
3. **Async Issue**: The toggle method wasn't properly awaiting async operations

## What I Fixed:

### 1. **Visual Disabled State** 🎨
- **Gray Colors**: When disabled, running button shows gray gradient instead of red
- **Disabled Icon**: Shows a block icon (🚫) and "DISABLED" text instead of counter
- **No Shadow**: Removes the button shadow to indicate inactive state

### 2. **Functional Disabling** ⚡
- **Non-Clickable**: Button becomes completely non-interactive when disabled
- **Proper State Check**: Added `isRunningDisabled` logic in ExerciseButton
- **Conditional Rendering**: Shows different content based on enabled/disabled state

### 3. **Fixed Async Logic** 🔄
- **Proper Await**: Fixed the `toggle()` method to properly await async operations
- **State Synchronization**: Ensures both providers stay in sync
- **Error Handling**: Maintains proper error states

## How It Works Now:

### **When Running is ENABLED (Toggle ON)**: ✅
- Running button shows **red color**
- Shows **counter (0/10km)** and progress bars
- Button is **clickable** and functional
- Running **counts toward daily completion**

### **When Running is DISABLED (Toggle OFF)**: ❌  
- Running button shows **gray color**
- Shows **🚫 DISABLED** instead of counter
- Button is **not clickable**
- Running **does NOT count toward daily completion**
- Only Push-ups, Sit-ups, and Squats are required

## Technical Details:

### **ExerciseButton Changes:**
```dart
// Check if running is disabled
final isRunningDisabled = widget.exerciseType == ExerciseType.running && 
    runningEnabledAsync.maybeWhen(
      data: (enabled) => !enabled,
      orElse: () => false,
    );

// Apply disabled styling and behavior
onTap: (isCompleted || isRunningDisabled) ? null : _handleTap,
```

### **Provider Fix:**
```dart
// Fixed async toggle method
Future<void> toggle() async {
  final currentEnabled = state.maybeWhen(
    data: (enabled) => enabled,
    orElse: () => true,
  );
  
  await setEnabled(!currentEnabled);
  await ref.read(currentWorkoutProvider.notifier).toggleRunningEnabled();
}
```

## User Experience:
- **Clear Visual Feedback**: Users can immediately see when running is disabled
- **Intuitive Behavior**: Disabled button can't be accidentally tapped
- **Flexible Workouts**: Users can focus on just the three exercises if preferred
- **Proper Daily Completion**: Only enabled exercises count toward completion

**The running toggle now works exactly as expected! 🎉**
